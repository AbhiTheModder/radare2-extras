Esil Abstract Structured Tree

## Description

This is a work in progress project that aims to provide work in progress
and experimental development towards getting a decompiler on top of the
R2 intermediate language (ESIL).

The main objective of this project is to raise esil to the level where
we can use it for decompilation, type propagation and advanced analysis.
